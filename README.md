My apologizes for the visualization, that is not my best point, but I can improve it.

Also, I leave the queries used on the Big Query.

I had not much time for developing more than that.

I choose the GCP because I have no free account for other clouds.

The script Pyspark can be used on Kubernetes environment too.
